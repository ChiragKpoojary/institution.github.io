        <h2>Welcome to Our College</h2>
        <p>I read in a local college that is the biggest and the best college in this area. With good results and other activities, my college has been ranked top every year. I am studying here for a year and I am enjoying the atmosphere here. The best thing about my college is its campus. I love to spend time on this campus. My college campus is so big. It has a huge area with ten buildings. Each building is for different divisions. There is a big playground inside the campus. Students keep playing cricket or football there all day long.
            The environment is so friendly. Anyone doesnâ€™t bother me or anyone. If you face any problem, everyone is so helpful. There are is a computer lab and college library in the east building. I spend most of my leisure time in the library when I am in college. It has a huge collection of great books. As a book lover, I enjoy my time there. The seniors and juniors have a good bonding on the campus. Everyone contributes to having a peaceful campus. I love my college campus a lot. I love to spend time there.</p>
